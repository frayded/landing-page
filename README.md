# Cityscape Night Gallery Landing Page
This is a repository made to complete The Odin Project's Landing Page assignment. Titled as "Cityscape Night Gallery", I used photos with the aforementioned theme.

## Thoughts
Honestly speaking, this is not my first time doing this project. I archived my first attempt with this project. And it looks like I didn't grow much in terms of making the page responsive. On the other hand, I'm pretty satisfied with this attempt as I understood flexbox layouting better this time.
<br>
Structure wise, I also like this better. Is this optimal? I would guess not but that's something you learn to be better as you go.
<br>
All in all, I like this project. Hopefully I can go back to this and fixing things that could be better later on as I progress.
